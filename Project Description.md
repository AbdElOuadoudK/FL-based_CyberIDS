# Vertical Federated Learning-based Architecture for Cyber Intrusion Detection
## Description
Cyber intrusion detection is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, aimed at identifying and mitigating threats to computer systems and networks. Traditional methods for intrusion detection often face challenges in handling diverse and rapidly evolving cyber threats. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a promising approach to address these challenges by enabling collaborative model training across distributed entities without sharing sensitive data. 

This repository contains the necessary requirements for the implementation of a federated architecture for Cyber Intrusion Detection. The research project focuses on developing a Vertical Federated Learning (FL)-based framework for collabortive generalization of IDSs. This innovative approach leverages federated learning to enhance cybersecurity measures without compromising data privacy.

## Motivations
This research project aims to leverage Federated Learning (FL) to enhance cyber intrusion detection capabilities. Traditional cybersecurity systems often face challenges related to data privacy, as centralized models require sharing sensitive data across networks. Federated Learning offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training across distributed devices while keeping data decentralized.

FL allows for model training on data distributed across various verticals (organizations, institutions) while preserving data privacy. This approach not only protects user privacy but also improves the scalability and accuracy of intrusion detection systems. It is particularly crucial in the context of cybersecurity, where data confidentiality is paramount and regulations such as GDPR impose stringent restrictions on data sharing.

## Objectives
***Develop an architecture tailored for Intrusion Detection*** 

The primary objective of this research is to design and develop a Vertical Federated Learning (FL) architecture specifically aimed at Cyber Intrusion Detection systems. This involves creating a framework that allows multiple distributed nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing sensitive data. The architecture will be designed to integrate seamlessly with existing cybersecurity frameworks and systems.

***Enhance privacy and security of the systems***

A key objective is to leverage Federated Learning techniques to enhance the privacy and security of intrusion detection systems. By keeping data decentralized and performing model training locally on each node, the architecture aims to mitigate risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access. Privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, and encryption will be employed to protect sensitive information.

***Address the challenges of model and data heterogeneity*** 

Data used for intrusion detection varies significantly across different nodes in terms of format, structure, and quality. One of the objectives is to address these challenges by developing techniques for data harmonization and model optimization in a federated learning setting. This includes adapting machine learning algorithms and optimization strategies to operate efficiently in a distributed, heterogeneous environment.

***Demonstrate the feasibility & effectiveness of the solution***

The research aims to empirically validate the proposed Vertical Federated Learning architecture through rigorous evaluations and case studies. This includes benchmarking the performance of the intrusion detection models against centralized approaches, assessing the scalability of the architecture, and evaluating its effectiveness in detecting and mitigating cyber threats. Real-world case studies will be conducted to demonstrate the applicability and benefits of the architecture in practical scenarios.
